        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I was born on May 20th, 1996. I have two brotehrs, one who is two years older than I am and the other is my twin brother. He is technically my younger brother since he's 15 minutes younger than me! I own have two dogs and they are schnoodles. I was born and raised in Portland and I really like the bridges although I hate walking across them because it terrifies me. I really love coding and I can't wait to see where it takes me!</p>
